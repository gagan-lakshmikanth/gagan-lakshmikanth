## 🚀 The Origin Story  

Once upon a spreadsheet 📊, in the wild land of supply chains and fintech stacks, I realized data wasn't just numbers — it was a *superpower*.  
From building dashboards that developers loved, to slicing ticket volumes with chatbot magic 🧙‍♂️🤖, I got hooked on **making data useful** — and kind of beautiful too.

My journey took me through:
- **Flipkart**: where I leveled up national reverse logistics ♻️ and turned chaos into customer satisfaction.
- **Scripbox**: where I partnered with engineers to tame platforms, build bots, and even play with some GenAI wizardry 🪄.

Now? I’m on a quest to bridge the gap between *decision fatigue* and *data-driven clarity*, with a side hustle of exploring vector databases and machine intelligence.
